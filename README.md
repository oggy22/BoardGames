# BoardGames
An extensible framework for programming search algorithms (minimax with cutting, killer moves, etc) and end-tables for board games such as two-player, full info board games such as chess, MNK, Connect4, checkers etc. Heavy use of teamplates and newer C++ features such as `constexpr`, `if constexpr`, `concepts`, `std::experimental::generator` and heavy use of C macros around chess moves.
